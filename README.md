## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:  

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Set up a Python virtual environment to isolate the dependencies:

For Linux/Mac:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root by copying the sample file provided:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Update the .env file with the necessary configurations, such as the path to your prompt file.

---

### Running the Framework

```bash
python convert.py
```

The convert.py script will prompt you to enter the folder path interactively.
Specify the folder containing your customized Java classes as an argument when running convert.py:

The framework will generate an Automation Script folder in the specified directory. The converted Python automation scripts will be stored as .py files in this folder.

### Sample .env File
Below is a sample .env file format for reference:
```bash
# watsonx variables
IBMC_AUTH_URL = "https://xxxxxxx/identity/token"
WX_ENDPOINT_URL = "https://xxxxxxxxxx/ml/v1/text/generation?version=2023-05-29"
WX_APIKEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
WX_PROJECT_ID = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
WX_MODEL_ID = "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01"
WX_PROMPT_FILE_NAME = 'prompt.txt'
# maximo variables
MAS_URL = "https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/maximo"
MAS_APIKEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

---

### Notes
The input folder must contain the Java custom classes you wish to convert.
All Python scripts generated by the framework will be stored in the Automation Script folder created inside the input directory.
Ensure the prompt file specified in the .env file is accurate and contains the required instructions for the conversion process.
